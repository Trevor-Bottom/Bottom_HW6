            <h2>About Trevor:</h2>
            <p>I was born in St. Louis, Missouri, and lived in University City for the first 18 months of my life. Then, I moved to the other side of the Mississippi River and spent the next couple of years in Glen Carbon, Illinois, before moving to Newtown, Connecticut. We lived there for almost six years before moving back to Illinois in 2011. Since fifth grade, I have lived in Wheaton, Illinois, where I graduated from Wheaton Warrenville South High School in 2019. I am the oldest of three siblings; I have two younger sisters, Corrin (currently a senior at Illinois State University) and Glenna (finishing up her senior year at Wheaton Warrenville South and will be heading to Boston University this fall). Some of my favorite activities include attending live sporting events, golfing, and hanging out with friends. I am an avid media consumer, enjoying movies, TV shows, YouTube channels, and more.</p>
            <p>I am currently a senior at the University of Iowa, studying business analytics and information systems. After my freshman year at the University of Kansas, I transferred to Iowa due to Covid, and I truly believe that was the best decision I've ever made. I'll be graduating this spring and plan on starting my role as a business applications consultant in downtown Chicago in late July.</p>
            <p>Before joining the "real world," my goals for the summer are to spend as much time as possible at the lake and to shoot even par at least once.</p>
